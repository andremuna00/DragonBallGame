## üìù Description
A DragonBall-inspired platformer developed in Java, created as a self-study project in my third year of high school. The game combines classic platforming mechanics with DragonBall's iconic transformation system and combat mechanics, featuring a comprehensive level design system and enemy AI.
## ‚≠ê Key Features

- Complete transformation system (Super Saiyan 1, 3, and God forms)
- Combat system with projectile attacks
- Enemy AI with health tracking
- Super Mario-style platforming
- Pixel map-based level design
- Full animation system
- Audio system with music and sound effects
- Progress save system

## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics
### Character Abilities

- Basic Movement: Left/Right movement, Jumping
- Combat: Energy projectiles (Space bar)
- Transformations:
    - Super Saiyan 1 (Key 1)
    - Super Saiyan 3 (Key 3)
    - Super Saiyan God (Key 4)
- Power scaling with each transformation:
    - Increased movement speed
    - Enhanced attack damage
